## Summary

My background in photography led me to come up with the idea for this app. I thought it would be interesting to create a platform for the public to add and review exhibitions they had visited. I utilized the  CRUD/RESTful concepts when creating my first full stack app, getting to know how to use Mongo make AJAX requests to my API.
